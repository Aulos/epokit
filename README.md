Huge thanks to everyone who donated to the fund drive that got the hardware into my hands to build this.
Thanks to Bryan Bishop and the other guys in #hplusroadmap on Freenode for your help and support.
And as always, thanks to my friends and family for supporting me and suffering through my obsession of the week.
